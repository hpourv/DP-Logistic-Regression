## Motivation
Machine Learning(ML) models can memorize training datasets. So Training ML models over private datasets can violate the privacy of individuals.
For Example, there is an an attack that can extract training data from a ML model:

* Model Inversion Attacks

In model inversion attacks, an adversary attempts to recover the private dataset used to train a ML model.
