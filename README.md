## Motivation
Machine Learning models can memorize training datasets.Training Machine Learning models over private datasets can violate the privacy of individuals.
For Example there are two types of attacks that can extract training data from a Machine Learning model.

* Model Inversion Attacks
* Membership Inference Attacks
