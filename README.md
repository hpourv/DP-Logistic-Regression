## Motivation
Machine Learning(ML) models can memorize training datasets. So, training ML models over private datasets can violate the privacy of individuals.
For Example, Model Inversion Attacks can extract training data from a ML model.

In model inversion attacks, an adversary attempts to recover the private dataset used to train a ML model.
